          <p>
            I enjoy playing video games and at this moment I am currently stuck
            on Dead by Daylight. It's a multiplayer escape the room type game. I
            enjoy playing with my roommates.

        <h2>Mechanical Keyboards</h2>

          <p>
            Another one of my hobbies is tinkering with mechanical keyboards.
            Mechanical keyboards are like your old style keyboards that rely on
            mechanical switches rather than rubber. There are thousands of
            different styles, feels, and aesthetics. I personally enjoy
            tinkering with multiple keyboards.

        <h2>Linux Tinkering</h2>

        <div class="pic-text">

          <p>
            I enjoy tinkering with the Linux operating system specifically with
            different window managers and different configurations. As a
            longtime Windows user after the new Windows 11 update I hated it. So
            instead I decided to go to the Linux operating system and fell down
            the rabbit hole of customizing every minute detail of your system. I
            enjoy tinkering with my tiling window manager and enjoy trying out
            Linux software
